Apigee Key Value Map Reset
=====================

checkvaultquota.py is used with a Jenkins job to check the value of a key value entry and reset the quota. If the key value entry is greater than 0, this script prints the current value and then resets the value to 0. 

This script is meant to be used with a Jenkins job, but works as a standalone program too.
